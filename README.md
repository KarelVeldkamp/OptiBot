# OptiBot
OptiBot is a Twitter bot that posts optimistic tweets about news headlines. It scrapes headlines from the News API, writes a positive tweet about them using GPT-3, and then tweets it to Twitter using the Twitter API. The URLs to the articles mentioned are added in the replies. 

This project is hosted on PythonAnywhere and runs everyday. It's a free hosting service so it will probably stop working at some point. 
You can see the tweets at our [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/Opti_News_Bot).
